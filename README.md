 Overview

So I was originally trying to learn about Java. This ended up being a crash course in how to use Eclipse IDE. 
I also learned about working with Git in Eclipse IDE. 

Right now, this contains how to set and print out variables. 

I wanted to create a program that stored login credentials.

Here is my walk through of the code and Eclipse IDE.
